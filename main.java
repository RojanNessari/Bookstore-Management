/**
 This java program is supposed to manage a book store. this simple
 Book Management System is used to effectively and efficiently manage
 registers (new books) and their corresponding attributes like title, author, ISBN and price.
 In this regard a class in Java identified as: Book.
 In this program a driver class is created to run the program.
 The program is executed in the main method.
